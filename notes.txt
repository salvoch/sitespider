Plan:

- Look into:
	- chevron
	- jinja2?
	- Mako?
	- marko
	- functools - partial
	- prettyprint (graphviz)
	- pygments for syntax highlighting
	- ark (for examples)

- Structure of my website


1. Decide what the structure of my website will look like
	- Title page
	- Categories
	- About me
	- Entries
	- topics under categories
	- Other (look into it)

	- embeded images/videos

	- What is the ultimate file directory to look like when it's ready to publish

2. Decide on templating
	- What templatating language will we use (chevron/jinja2/mako)
	- What templates will we need

3. Decide on what options this site will have
	- Why where we parsing yaml?
	- What were we trying to convey with the json?
	- We had options for:
	- applying a template to a category
	- number of posts
	- directory path
	- default template
	- template for home page

4. decide what the input directory will look like
	- md files, but where?
	- Main file
	- sub directories
	- where images?

5. how do we convert .md to html?
	- figure out how to parse

6. Decide on the aesthetics of the website
	- Simple CSS templates
	- maybe http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/

7. host website? Run like a "serve" command

8. How to host this on salvoch.com

What's missing:
	1. Logic for creating website structure
	2. Main page logic for generating
		- structure
		- sub topics
		- showing x number of posts
	3. Each topic should have its own index page
		- with all posts for that toipc & maybe some deets?
	4. Templating
		- Header/footer/layout (constant HTML)
		- CSS
	5. Top level main to run it (CLI tool)
		- nested directories won't work (use pathlib parts?)
		- proper CLI argument parsing (--build_directory, -f, etc)
		- make it flexible between OSs
		- write exceptions
	6. Syntax highlighting 
	7. images?
	8. package program

- run main.py
	- find all md files in directory
	- convert them to html



=== useful Pathlib.Path stuff

g = Path('root')

you can do things like

p = g / 'images'

which results in 

p being root/images

p.resolve() will give you the whole path (/user/ms/documents/orot/images)

can do:
q.exists()
q.is_dir()

open file

with q.open() as f: f.read()

Can convert between Path and PurePath

Path(g), or PurePath(h)

PurePath() are just strings, it has no concept of the file structure, but does windows/posix depending on OS

Path() understands its file system, so it can delete/create files and directories,
